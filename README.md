# BBScript - [Releases Here](https://github.com/super-continent/bbscript/releases)

## What does this tool do?
This program is made to allow anyone to parse BBScript into a readable (and modifiable) format. It functions through game databases in [RON](https://github.com/ron-rs/ron) format, allowing it to be extended to work with any ArcSys game using BBScript regardless of the differences in functions and their corresponding values. This means it should be able to work with Guilty Gear Xrd, DBFZ, Blazblue, and Granblue Fantasy Versus if given the correct data in the form of .ron files.

## How Do I Start Modding?
Depending on the game, there are some guides:
- [Guilty Gear Strive Modding Guide](https://pangaea.neocities.org/post/guilty-gear-strive-modding/)
- [Guilty Gear Xrd](https://github.com/super-continent/bbscript/wiki/Guilty-Gear-Xrd-Modding-Guide)

## What is BBScript?
BBScript is a script format used by Arc System Works to define functions in their games such as character moves. It's used in most modern ArcSys games such as Blazblue CentralFiction, Guilty Gear Xrd, Dragon Ball FighterZ, and Granblue Fantasy Versus.

## Credit
Thanks to Labryz and Dantarion for assembling the original DB info in [bbtools](https://github.com/dantarion/bbtools) and for bbtools as a good reference code base for info about the script format 

Special thanks to the quarantine for providing me with enough free time to waste a whole 2 weeks challenging myself to make something that like 5 people will think is actually cool
